# Movement Room

## The Idea of the Movement Room

_Why a movement room at a hackathon?_

People at the hackathon come together to discover and to develop something new. They work in small teams. But they only have 3 days to get to know each other and to create together.

The movement room is a safe environment to support the work in the teams in an energetic way. We meet to discover how can we enter each other spaces and connect with other people — through movement or dance.

I am interested in the question: What happens if all these people start to move and activate different areas in their body — how much more creative will their work be? Does it have an effect on them? How do people which are not coming from a dancing / moving background feel to open up in a movement room? How do they accept it?

We will “move” to activate the right side of the brain — the part for the creativity in our mind. We also wake up tired bodies, massage stiff necks, give time to relax, to breath and most important thing: to have fun!

But more than that we explore the sensitivity to read and to meet each other in movement. How can we stay aware for each other?

We learn basic tools of contact dance like sharing the weight, rolling point of contact, leaning and supporting. We explore ideas of Improvisation - timing, playing, decisions, instant compositions:  Tools to create something new together. The base of the ETH in Berlin.

Everyone is welcome! There are no experiences in dance required.

# Summary of schedule for the movementroom:

## Saturday 8 September

- let’s get your team stronger!

> You just built your team? You only have 2 days to create? No time to lose? Come to this workshop to get to know each other better in a fun way, that also wakes up your body and the right side of your brain (that's the part where the creativity lives ;) ) First frustration arises? Dance them away!

```
Round 1 - 1400 - 1430
Round 2 - 1430 - 1500
```

- creative people in sitting positions 

> I want to offer a movement workshop that is more than only loosen your pain in the shoulders and neck. A workshop that goes along with the idea of “coding”. Every one of us has their own body language — a code to read, to understand. How is it possible that we can read each other so quickly? But do we understand ourselves? In non-verbal communication such as movement or dance it’s all about the listening and understanding. You will find out? Am I a leader? A follower? Can I take over responsibility? Can I let go? How do I react if someone is stepping into my space?

```
Round 1 - 1630 - 1700
Round 2 - 1730 - 1800
```

- open-drop-in-movement-jam

> You are welcome at any time! Come on your own to jump around! To get free of all the thoughts! Come in your team to do something else then hacking! Do the coding dance! Whenever its good for you! Find room and space for yourself, let your thoughts flow, let your body decide what to do and meet others you haven’ t even seen yet. Get in contact with others though movement and activate your mind before you hack yourself through the night — or you fall asleep exhausted. In the end of the jam we all calm down to-gether. Live music by the wonderful Alice Rose (DK) and her Loop Station.

```
Round 1 - 1900 - 1930
Round 2 - 1945 - 2015
Open Jam until 2100
```

## Sunday 9 September


- awaken your mind

> Last day! You had a working-trough night? Maybe you had some beers, feeling a bit heavy in your head? Let’s shake the body, get some fresh energy, soft stretches, wake up our minds, the right and left side of the brain, we roll our stiff shoulders and neck to be ready for the last round! Be flexible and there are no borders in you.

```
Round 1 - 0930 - 1000
Round 2 - 1000 - 1030
```

- let’s stay in contact 

> Time to come together to take a moment to “digest” what happened during these last few days. Gift yourself some relaxing time, decode your body and mind through guided movement, find a way to store and refill yourself. Breathe and feel the freedom.

```
Round 1 - 1200 - 1230
Round 2 - 1230 - 1300
```
